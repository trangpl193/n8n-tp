# 🚀 PM2 Auto-Initialization Branch

**Branch:** `pm2-auto-initialization`  
**Created:** August 1, 2025  
**Base:** `develop` branch (commit: ad02db856)

## 🎯 **Development Goals**

### 1. **Auto-Initialization System**
- Implement automatic PM2 process management
- Auto-detect and start required services
- Health checking and auto-recovery
- Dependency management (database, services)

### 2. **Smart Startup Logic**
- Environment detection (dev/staging/production)
- Port conflict resolution
- Database connection validation
- Service availability checks

### 3. **Enhanced Process Management**
- Multi-environment PM2 configs
- Graceful shutdown handling
- Log rotation and management
- Performance monitoring

### 4. **User Experience Improvements**
- One-command startup
- Status dashboard
- Automated troubleshooting
- Configuration validation

## 🛠️ **Current Implementation Status**

### ✅ **Completed**
- Basic PM2 ecosystem configs
- Production environment setup
- Domain configuration (strangematic.com)
- Cloudflared tunnel integration

### 🔄 **In Development**
- [ ] Auto-initialization scripts
- [ ] Environment detection
- [ ] Health checking system
- [ ] Database validation
- [ ] Service dependency management

### 📋 **Planned Features**
- [ ] Windows Service integration
- [ ] Auto-recovery mechanisms
- [ ] Performance optimization
